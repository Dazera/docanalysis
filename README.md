Examining the quotation of documents in the dynastic histories, especially in the early medieval period. 

The main work is in the `DocAnalysis3b` notebook.  It relies on `Book2` (methods for collecting and organizing the histories) and `DocCollect` (methods for extracting the documents and examining their vocabulary).

With many rough edges.
